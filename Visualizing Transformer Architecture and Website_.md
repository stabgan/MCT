# **Visualizing Complexity: A Guide to Diagramming and Web Presentation for the MedCode-Transformer Methodology**

The effective communication of complex deep learning architectures, such as the MedCode-Transformer (MCT), is paramount for disseminating research findings and facilitating understanding within the scientific community. This report provides a comprehensive guide to creating an aesthetic, informative visual diagram of the MCT model's methodology and developing a supporting project website. It focuses on detailing the encoder-decoder architecture, its layers, their sizes, and internal components, while also recommending suitable tools, libraries, and languages.

## **1\. Deconstructing the MedCode-Transformer (MCT) for Visual Representation**

Before a visual representation can be created, a thorough understanding of the MedCode-Transformer's architecture is essential. This involves identifying its core structure and the specific components and parameters that define its functionality.

### **1.1. Core Architecture Overview: The Encoder-Decoder Backbone**

The MedCode-Transformer (MCT) model is fundamentally an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.1 This structure is a well-established paradigm for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and, in this context, medical code generation and synthetic medical text generation.2 The encoder component is responsible for processing the input medical text, transforming it into a rich, contextualized representation. The decoder component then utilizes this representation to generate the desired output, such as hierarchical ICD-10-CM codes or synthetic clinical narratives.1

A key architectural characteristic of the MCT model is its asymmetric design, featuring 20 layers in the encoder and 7 layers in the decoder.1 This asymmetry is a deliberate choice, reflecting a design philosophy where greater complexity and representational power are allocated to the encoder for a deep understanding of the input medical text.1 The visual diagram should subtly yet clearly convey this asymmetry, perhaps by depicting the encoder stack as more substantial (e.g., taller or visually heavier) than the decoder stack. Such a visual cue can intuitively communicate this important design aspect without requiring extensive textual annotation, allowing viewers to quickly grasp a core element of the MCT's design rationale. The interaction between the encoder and decoder, primarily through the cross-attention mechanism in the decoder layers 1, is another critical aspect that must be clearly delineated in the visualization.

### **1.2. Identifying Key Components and Parameters for Visualization**

A detailed and accurate visual representation requires the identification and quantification of all critical architectural components and their associated parameters. For the MCT model, these include:

* **Embedding Layer:** The model begins with a factorized embedding parameterization.  
  * Vocabulary Size (V): 100,000 tokens.1  
  * Factorized Embedding Dimension (E): 256\.1  
  * Model Hidden Size (H or dmodel​): 1024\.1 The embedding process involves mapping token IDs to E-dimensional vectors, which are then projected to the H-dimensional space. This two-step process is crucial for parameter efficiency.1  
* **Positional Encoding:** Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) are employed, with a hyperparameter θ=1,000,000. RoPE is applied directly within the attention layers to the query and key projections.1  
* **MCT Encoder (20 Layers,** Le​=20**):** 1  
  * Hidden Size (dmodel​): 1024\.  
  * Feed-Forward Network (FFN) Intermediate Size (dffe​​): 3072 (calculated as 3×dmodel​), using SwiGLU activation function.  
  * Attention Mechanism:  
    * Number of Attention Heads (nheadse​​): 16, resulting in a head dimension (dhead​) of 1024/16=64.  
    * Grouped Query Attention (GQA): Utilizes 4 Key/Value (KV) heads (nkv\_headse​​=4), leading to a 4:1 GQA ratio (16 query heads to 4 KV heads).  
    * Interleaved Local/Global Attention: A pattern of 3 local attention layers followed by 1 global attention layer is repeated. This results in 15 local and 5 global attention layers over the 20-layer stack. The local attention span is configurable (e.g., 2048-4096 tokens).  
  * Normalization and Regularization: QK-Normalization in attention, Pre-Layer Normalization using RMSNorm (epsilon 1e−6), linear layers generally without bias terms, and a dropout rate of 0.1.  
* **MCT Decoder (7 Layers,** Ld​=7**):** 1  
  * Hidden Size (dmodel​): 1024\.  
  * Feed-Forward Network (FFN) Intermediate Size (dffd​​): 3072 (3×dmodel​), using SwiGLU activation.  
  * Attention Mechanisms:  
    1. Masked Self-Attention:  
       * Number of Attention Heads (nheads\_d\_self​): 16\.  
       * Grouped Query Attention (GQA): 8 Key/Value (KV) heads (nkv\_heads\_d\_self​=8), resulting in a 2:1 GQA ratio.  
       * Causal Masking is applied.  
       * QK-Normalization.  
    2. Cross-Attention (Attending to Encoder Output):  
       * Number of Attention Heads (nheads\_d\_cross​): 16 (standard Multi-Head Attention).  
       * QK-Normalization.  
  * Positional Encoding: RoPE is used for the self-attention mechanism.  
  * Normalization and Regularization: Pre-Layer Normalization using RMSNorm (epsilon 1e−6), linear layers generally without bias terms, and a dropout rate of 0.1.  
* **Output Embeddings / Language Modeling (LM) Head:** A factorized approach similar to the input embeddings is used, with weight tying between the input embedding layer and the output LM head.1

Compiling these parameters into a centralized table serves multiple purposes. It provides an accessible, at-a-glance reference for the diagram designer and for subsequent viewers of the diagram or website. It also acts as an accuracy check, verifying the understanding of the model specifications before the visualization process commences. Furthermore, these quantitative details (e.g., layer counts, head counts, dimensions) directly inform the visual encoding choices, such as the number of repeating units to draw, the relative sizes of components, and the annotations on the diagram. For example, knowing Le​=20 and Ld​=7 immediately dictates that the encoder stack should be visually represented as significantly deeper than the decoder stack. This ensures consistency between the textual descriptions in the thesis and the visual depiction of the architecture.

**Table 1: MedCode-Transformer (MCT) \- Key Architectural Parameters for Visualization**

| Parameter | Value | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Vocabulary Size (V) | 100,000 | 1 |
| Factorized Embedding Dimension (E) | 256 | 1 |
| Model Hidden Size (H / dmodel​) | 1024 | 1 |
| Encoder Layers (Le​) | 20 | 1 |
| Encoder FFN Intermediate Size (dffe​​) | 3072 | 1 |
| Encoder Attention Heads (nheadse​​) | 16 | 1 |
| Encoder KV Heads (nkv\_headse​​) | 4 | 1 |
| Encoder GQA Ratio | 4:1 | 1 |
| Encoder Local/Global Attention Pattern | 3 Local : 1 Global | 1 |
| Decoder Layers (Ld​) | 7 | 1 |
| Decoder FFN Intermediate Size (dffd​​) | 3072 | 1 |
| Decoder Self-Attention Heads (nheads\_d\_self​) | 16 | 1 |
| Decoder Self-Attention KV Heads (nkv\_heads\_d\_self​) | 8 | 1 |
| Decoder Self-Attention GQA Ratio | 2:1 | 1 |
| Decoder Cross-Attention Heads (nheads\_d\_cross​) | 16 | 1 |
| RoPE Theta (θ) | 1,000,000 | 1 |

This comprehensive list ensures that no critical architectural detail is overlooked during the visualization process, providing a solid foundation for an accurate and informative diagram.

## **2\. Designing an Aesthetic and Informative MCT Diagram**

Creating a diagram that is both technically accurate and visually appealing requires careful consideration of design principles and specific strategies for representing the MCT model's unique components.

### **2.1. Principles of Effective Neural Network Visualization for Technical Audiences**

Effective neural network diagrams serve as crucial communication tools, bridging the gap between complex architectures and audience comprehension.6 Key principles include:

* **Clarity:** The representation of components and data flow must be unambiguous. Each element should have a clear purpose and its connections to other elements should be easily traceable.  
* **Consistency:** Uniform notation, shapes, and color schemes should be used for similar components or concepts throughout the diagram. This aids recognition and reduces cognitive load.  
* **Abstraction:** While detail is important, excessive complexity can overwhelm. The diagram should abstract away unnecessary intricacies, focusing on the most salient features and interactions that define the architecture.  
* **Modularity:** Transformer architectures are inherently modular, with repeating blocks (encoder/decoder layers). The diagram should leverage this by clearly defining a single block and then showing it stacked, rather than drawing every layer in full detail.  
* **Information Density:** A balance must be struck between providing sufficient detail and maintaining readability. The diagram should be informative without being cluttered.  
* **Guided Narration:** A well-designed diagram guides the viewer's eye through the model, telling a story about how data is processed and transformed from input to output.7

The request for an "aesthetic UI/UX" diagram underscores the need to move beyond purely functional schematics. Visual appeal, achieved through thoughtful use of color palettes, typography, spacing, and overall composition, significantly enhances comprehension and engagement.9 The diagram itself should offer a positive "user experience," being intuitive and easy to interpret. For instance, a consistent color for all attention blocks, another for FFNs, and distinct visual cues for operations like "Add & RMSNorm" can greatly improve both readability and aesthetic quality, aligning with principles of good UI design.10

### **2.2. Visualizing the MCT Encoder (20 Layers)**

The MCT encoder, with its 20 layers, is a substantial part of the architecture and requires careful visual treatment.

* **Stack Representation:** The 20 encoder layers should be depicted as a stack of identical blocks, clearly labeled "MCT Encoder x20".2 This immediately conveys the depth of the encoder.  
* **Single Encoder Block Detail:** A "zoomed-in" or expanded view of a single encoder block is essential to illustrate its internal components:  
  * **Multi-Head Attention (MHA) with Grouped Query Attention (GQA):** This is a complex but critical component.  
    * Visually differentiate the projections that create Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors from the input.  
    * Represent the nheadse​​=16 query heads.  
    * The GQA mechanism, where nkv\_headse​​=4 K/V heads are shared across groups of Q heads (4:1 ratio), must be clearly illustrated.1 This might involve showing, for example, four Q heads sharing a single K/V head pair. Conceptual diagrams of GQA can provide inspiration for this representation.13  
    * An annotation or small icon should indicate the use of QK-Normalization.  
  * **Interleaved Local/Global Attention:** This unique feature of the MCT encoder, designed to handle long medical documents by capturing both local and long-range dependencies 1, needs a distinct visual representation. The 3:1 pattern (3 local attention layers followed by 1 global attention layer, repeated 5 times to make up the 20 layers) can be shown by:  
    * Color-coding or distinct labeling of the blocks within the main encoder stack overview (e.g., three "Local Attention Encoder Block" graphics followed by one "Global Attention Encoder Block" graphic, with this group of four repeated).  
    * The "zoomed-in" view might need two variants: one for a local attention block and one for a global attention block, highlighting how their attention scope differs (e.g., local attention might show connections to a limited window of tokens, while global attention shows connections to all tokens). Visual concepts from literature on local/global attention can be adapted.17 This multi-level depiction (overview of the pattern in the stack, and detailed views of block types) effectively communicates not just the architecture's structure but also the rationale behind this design choice for processing long sequences.  
  * **Feed-Forward Network (FFN):** This can be represented as a standard two-layer MLP. Annotations should indicate the SwiGLU activation function and the input/output dimension (dmodel​=1024) and intermediate size (dffe​​=3072).  
  * **Residual Connections & Layer Normalization (RMSNorm):** These are standard Transformer components and should be shown wrapping around each of the sub-layers (attention and FFN).8 Clear labeling such as "Add & RMSNorm" is crucial.  
* **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) Integration:** RoPE is applied to the Q and K vectors within the attention mechanism itself, rather than being added to the initial embeddings like traditional positional encodings.1 This can be depicted as an operation (e.g., a rotation symbol or a small labeled box) applied directly to the Q and K vectors before they are used in the attention score calculation.20

### **2.3. Visualizing the MCT Decoder (7 Layers)**

The MCT decoder, while shallower with 7 layers, has its own specific mechanisms that need clear visualization.

* **Stack Representation:** Similar to the encoder, depict the 7 decoder layers as a stack of identical blocks, labeled "MCT Decoder x7".2  
* **Single Decoder Block Detail:** An expanded view of one decoder block should show its three main sub-layers:  
  * **Masked Self-Attention (with GQA):**  
    * This layer attends to the previously generated tokens in the output sequence. The "masked" aspect, preventing attention to future tokens (causal masking), is critical and often visualized by graying out or omitting connections to subsequent positions, or with a triangular mask symbol.  
    * It employs GQA with nheads\_d\_self​=16 query heads and nkv\_heads\_d\_self​=8 K/V heads (a 2:1 ratio).1 This shared K/V structure should be illustrated.  
    * Indicate QK-Normalization.  
  * **Cross-Attention (Encoder-Decoder Attention):** This is where the decoder interacts with the encoder's output.  
    * The Query (Q) vectors for this layer come from the output of the preceding masked self-attention layer within the decoder.  
    * The Key (K) and Value (V) vectors come from the final output of the entire encoder stack.2 This flow of K and V from encoder to decoder is a hallmark of encoder-decoder Transformers and must be visually prominent.  
    * This sub-layer uses nheads\_d\_cross​=16 standard multi-head attention heads.1  
    * Indicate QK-Normalization.  
  * **Feed-Forward Network (FFN):** Identical in structure to the encoder's FFN (two-layer MLP with SwiGLU), with dimensions dmodel​=1024 and dffd​​=3072.  
  * **Residual Connections & Layer Normalization (RMSNorm):** These should be shown around each of these three sub-layers.  
* **RoPE Integration:** RoPE is applied to the Q and K vectors within the masked self-attention mechanism 1, similar to its application in the encoder.

### **2.4. Illustrating Data Flow: From Input Tokenization to Output Embeddings**

A comprehensive diagram must trace the complete journey of data through the MCT model.

* **Input:** Begin with a representation of "Medical Text / ICD-10 Codes" as the initial input.  
* **Tokenizer:** A block labeled "Hybrid Tokenizer (100k Vocab)" should follow.1 If space and clarity permit, sub-components like "Semantic ICD Tokens," "BPE/WordPiece Medical Text Tokens," and "Special Control Tokens" could be listed briefly within or near this block.  
* **Token IDs:** The output of the tokenizer should be shown as a sequence of "Token IDs."  
* **Factorized Embedding Layer:** This is a critical two-stage process that contributes to parameter efficiency 1 and should be visualized distinctly:  
  1. **Token ID to Factorized Embedding:** Show the Token IDs being mapped to lower-dimensional embedding vectors (dimension E=256). This can be represented as a lookup from a large table (conceptually V×E).  
  2. **Projection to Model Hidden Size:** These E-dimensional vectors are then projected to the main model hidden size (dimension H=1024) via a linear projection layer (weights E×H). Visualizing this two-step transformation explicitly highlights the efficiency gain over a direct V×H embedding matrix, a point emphasized in the thesis.1 An annotation such as "Factorized Embedding: V (100k) → E (256) → H (1024) – Parameter Efficient" would reinforce this. Inspirations for visualizing factorized embeddings can be drawn from diagrams explaining models like ALBERT, which also use this technique.21  
* **Positional Encoding (RoPE):** RoPE is not added as a separate vector but is incorporated into the attention mechanism by modifying query and key vectors. This should be shown as an operation within the attention blocks of both encoder and decoder, applied to the H-dimensional vectors.  
* **Encoder Stack:** The sequence of H-dimensional vectors (now with positional information implicitly included for attention calculations) flows through the 20-layer encoder stack.  
* **Encoder Output to Decoder:** Clear arrows must depict the flow of the encoder's final hidden states (context vectors) to *each* of the 7 decoder layers, specifically feeding into their cross-attention sub-layers.  
* **Decoder Stack:** The decoder processes its inputs (initially a start token, then previously generated tokens) along with the encoder's context, generating a sequence of H-dimensional output vectors.  
* **Decoder Output to LM Head:** The final hidden states from the top decoder layer are passed to the Language Modeling (LM) Head.  
* **Factorized Output/LM Head:** This part mirrors the input embedding factorization but in reverse, also for parameter efficiency 1:  
  1. **Projection to Factorized Embedding:** The H-dimensional decoder outputs are projected back down to the E-dimensional space (256).  
  2. **Factorized Embedding to Vocabulary Logits:** These E-dimensional vectors are then multiplied by the (transposed) initial token embedding matrix (the V×E matrix, now used as E×V) to produce logits over the entire 100,000-token vocabulary. The tying of weights with the input embedding matrix is an important detail.  
* **Output:** The final output can be labeled as "Predicted ICD-10 Codes / Synthetic Text."

This detailed flow, especially the explicit visualization of the factorized embedding and output layers, is crucial for a complete understanding of MCT's mechanics and efficiency considerations.1

### **2.5. Clearly Indicating Layer Sizes, Head Counts, and Dimensionality**

Quantitative details are vital for technical diagrams. Consistent and clear annotations should be used throughout:

* Next to the encoder stack: "Encoder x20, dmodel​=1024".  
* Next to the decoder stack: "Decoder x7, dmodel​=1024".  
* Within an encoder attention block: "16 Query Heads", "4 Shared K/V Heads (GQA 4:1)".  
* Within a decoder self-attention block: "16 Query Heads", "8 Shared K/V Heads (GQA 2:1)".  
* Within a decoder cross-attention block: "16 Attention Heads".  
* For FFNs: "FFN (dff​=3072)".  
* Input/output dimensions of layers should be indicated, e.g., Embedding: V→E→H. Standard notations like dmodel​, dff​, nheads​, Le​, Ld​ should be used consistently.1 Many Transformer diagrams illustrate these dimensions effectively, often by showing the width or depth of blocks representing tensors or layers.8 The specific choice of dimensions, such as dhead​=dmodel​/nheads​=1024/16=64, is a common practice in Transformer design. Clearly annotating these allows individuals familiar with Transformers to quickly recognize standard configurations and verify the model's adherence to these, building confidence in the diagram's technical accuracy.

### **2.6. Strategies for Achieving an Aesthetic UI/UX in Technical Diagrams**

An aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly diagram enhances comprehension and engagement.

* **Layout:** Employ a clear, logical flow, typically left-to-right for the encoder-to-decoder progression. Use alignment grids and maintain consistent spacing between elements. For a complex model like MCT, consider a main overview diagram supplemented by smaller, "zoomed-in" detailed views for intricate components like a GQA-enabled attention head or the representation of the interleaved local/global attention pattern.  
* **Color:** Use a limited, harmonious, and purposeful color palette.10 Colors can differentiate major modules (e.g., encoder in one shade, decoder in another), types of operations (e.g., attention layers in blue, FFNs in green), or data flow paths. Ensure high contrast between text/elements and their backgrounds for readability, considering accessibility.  
* **Typography:** Select a clean, legible sans-serif font family. Use variations in font weight (bold, regular) and size hierarchically to denote titles, labels, and annotations, guiding the reader's attention to key information.  
* **Iconography and Shapes:** Use consistent shapes for similar components (e.g., rectangles for layers, parallelograms for input/output, specific icons for operations like RoPE or GQA if designed clearly and minimally). While various styles exist 6, consistency within the diagram is paramount. The thickness or 3D aspect of blocks can subtly indicate layer dimensions or data tensor sizes.7  
* **Simplicity and Clarity:** Avoid visual clutter. Include only information essential for understanding the architecture. As suggested in UI/UX principles, limiting choices and focusing on essential information improves clarity.10 Well-known visual explanations of Transformer architectures, such as those by Jay Alammar, serve as excellent examples of balancing detail with clarity and effective visual storytelling.24 Interactive tools like the "Transformer Explainer" also offer inspiration for breaking down complexity visually.27

## **3\. Recommended Tools and Technologies for Diagram Creation**

The choice of tools depends on the desired output (static vs. interactive), required level of customization, and the user's technical skills.

### **3.1. Static Diagram Generation**

Static diagrams are suitable for publications, presentations, and embedding as images on websites.

#### **3.1.1. Code-based Tools (High Customization, Reproducibility)**

These tools generate diagrams from code, offering precision and version control.

* **Python with Matplotlib & Extensions:** Matplotlib is a foundational plotting library in Python. While highly flexible for general plotting, creating complex neural network diagrams directly can be verbose and may require significant custom code.2 Specific extensions or higher-level libraries might simplify this, but direct examples for full Transformer architectures are not prevalent.  
* **PlotNeuralNet:** This Python library generates LaTeX code (using TikZ) for producing high-quality, publication-ready neural network diagrams.28 The architecture is defined in Python scripts. It excels at creating precise, static visuals commonly seen in academic papers. However, representing highly specific or novel components like MCT's GQA variations or the interleaved attention pattern might require advanced TikZ customization.  
* **NN-SVG:** A web-based tool that allows users to define neural network architectures parametrically and export them as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files.30 It offers predefined styles (e.g., FCNN, LeNet). Its capability to easily represent the detailed nuances of the MCT's attention mechanisms (GQA, interleaved local/global) directly through its interface would need to be verified, as it might be geared towards more standard layer types.  
* **StarVector:** This is a more recent, research-oriented approach using a multimodal large language model to generate SVG code from image or text prompts.32 While innovative for general SVG generation and capable of understanding semantics, it might not yet offer the precise control needed for detailed, accurate architectural diagrams of a specific model like MCT unless specifically trained or prompted with highly detailed instructions. It could potentially be used to generate stylistic elements or basic shapes.

#### **3.1.2. GUI-based Tools (Ease of Use, Visual Iteration)**

These tools offer a visual interface for diagram creation.

* **Lucidchart and draw.io (diagrams.net):** These are general-purpose online diagramming tools. They provide a wide array of shapes, connectors, and styling options, making them suitable for creating block diagrams and flowcharts.34 Lucidchart also incorporates AI-assisted diagramming features.35 draw.io is a free and open-source option. Achieving a highly polished and detailed neural network diagram requires manual effort but is feasible.  
* **Adobe Illustrator and Figma:** These are professional vector graphics editors offering maximum control over aesthetics and detail \[75 (Illustrator); 11 (Figma concepts)\]. They have a steeper learning curve but are unparalleled for creating custom, high-fidelity visuals, especially if a unique aesthetic is desired. Figma is particularly strong for UI/UX design and collaboration.36

The selection between code-based and GUI-based tools for static diagrams involves a trade-off. Code-based tools offer precision, reproducibility, and are excellent for version control. GUI-based tools provide ease of use, especially for those less inclined to code their visuals, and allow for rapid visual iteration. For an architecture as specific and detailed as the MCT, a hybrid approach could be highly effective. Initial layout, component style exploration, and aesthetic refinement might be done in a GUI tool like Figma or Illustrator to achieve the desired "UI/UX" feel. Then, these design choices could be translated into a code-based tool (like PlotNeuralNet or custom Python scripting) for generating the repetitive elements (e.g., the 20 encoder layers) with precision and consistency. Alternatively, the overall structure could be laid out in a GUI tool, with more complex, detailed components (like an attention head with GQA) generated as SVGs from code and then imported. This balances the need for aesthetic quality with the demands of accuracy and scalability for numerous similar components.

### **3.2. Interactive Diagram Libraries (for Web Integration)**

Interactive diagrams can significantly enhance user engagement and understanding when presenting the methodology on a website. They allow users to explore the model, hover for details, click to expand sections, or even see animations of data flow. The "Transformer Explainer" is an excellent example of such an interactive educational tool.27

* **D3.js:** A powerful and highly flexible JavaScript library for creating custom, dynamic, and interactive data visualizations directly in the web browser using SVG, HTML, and CSS.38 While D3.js offers unparalleled control and can undoubtedly be used to create any conceivable Transformer visualization, it has a steep learning curve and requires significant development effort. General examples for interactive charts are abundant 44, but specific, comprehensive tutorials for Transformer architectures are less common.43  
* **React Flow:** A React-based library specifically designed for building node-based interactive editors and diagrams.46 Nodes in React Flow are standard React components, allowing for extensive customization with interactive elements and styling. It is well-suited for representing flow charts and graphs where components (like Transformer layers or blocks) are nodes and data flow is represented by edges. A rich set of examples is available 46, and it's used in various tools, including some for visualizing ML/AI workflows.47  
* **Cytoscape.js:** A JavaScript library focused on graph and network visualization and analysis, often used in bioinformatics and social network analysis.38 While it excels at visualizing complex relational data, it might be less intuitive for representing the stacked, layered structure typical of Transformer architectures, unless the visualization aims for a very abstract connectivity graph.

The decision to incorporate an interactive diagram has significant implications. It pushes the website development towards using JavaScript frameworks (like React if React Flow is chosen) rather than simpler static site generation approaches. The development time for a custom interactive D3.js Transformer diagram, for example, is substantially greater than creating a static SVG. Therefore, the pedagogical benefits of interactivity must be carefully weighed against this increased complexity and development effort, especially within the timeframe of an M.Tech thesis project. A well-crafted static SVG diagram might be a more pragmatic and achievable goal while still meeting the requirements for clarity and aesthetics.

### **3.3. Model Inspection Tools for Reference**

While not intended for generating the final presentation diagram, model inspection tools are invaluable for understanding the model's structure from its computational graph and verifying the accuracy of any manually created diagrams.

* **Netron:** A visualizer for neural network, deep learning, and machine learning models, supporting a wide array of formats including ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch, and Keras.51 Netron provides an interactive view of the model graph, allowing inspection of layers, their attributes, and input/output tensors. It is excellent for exploring the *actual* model structure if a saved model file is available.  
* **TensorBoard (Graph Tab):** TensorFlow's visualization toolkit includes a graph dashboard that visualizes the computational graph, illustrating operations and the flow of tensors between them.51 This is particularly useful if the MCT model is implemented in TensorFlow or Keras.  
* **BertViz:** A specialized tool for visualizing attention mechanisms in Transformer models like BERT and GPT-2.58 It offers different views (head view, model view, neuron view) to explore attention patterns. While excellent for understanding attention, it's not designed for creating overall architecture diagrams.  
* **Lucid:** A research-oriented library for TensorFlow models, focused on visualizing and understanding what neural networks learn through techniques like feature visualization and activation atlases.60 It helps interpret learned features rather than diagramming the architecture itself.

These inspection tools can serve as a "ground truth" reference, helping to ensure that the manually designed diagram accurately reflects the model's implemented structure.

**Table 2: Comparative Analysis of Diagramming Tools for Transformer Architectures**

| Feature | PlotNeuralNet | NN-SVG | Netron | D3.js | React Flow | Lucidchart / draw.io | Illustrator / Figma |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Output Type** | Static (LaTeX/PDF/PNG) | Static (SVG) | Interactive (Web viewer) | Interactive (Web/SVG) | Interactive (Web/React) | Static (PNG/SVG/PDF) | Static (SVG/PNG/PDF/etc.) |

| **Customization Level** | Medium (High with TikZ skill) | Medium | Low (view only) | Very High | High (via React) | Medium | Very High |
| **Ease of Rep. Transformer Details (GQA, RoPE, Stacks, Dims)** | Medium (needs TikZ for novel) | Low-Medium (may lack specifics) | High (if in model file) | High (requires coding) | High (requires coding) | Medium (manual effort) | High (manual effort) |
| **Learning Curve** | Medium (Python \+ LaTeX) | Low-Medium | Low | Very High | Medium (React \+ Lib API) | Low | Medium-High |
| **Web Integration** | PNG/SVG embed | SVG embed | Web version available | Native | Native (React app) | PNG/SVG embed | SVG/PNG embed |

This table aims to provide a structured comparison to aid in selecting the most appropriate tool(s) based on specific needs for visualizing the MCT architecture, balancing factors like desired output, customization, ease of use, and web integration capabilities.

## **4\. Developing a Project Website for the MCT Methodology**

A project website serves as a public-facing platform to present the MCT methodology, showcase the visual diagram, and share research findings.

### **4.1. Selecting an Appropriate Web Development Framework/Platform**

The choice of web development framework will influence the ease of development, content management, performance, and the ability to integrate interactive visualizations.

* **Static Site Generators (SSGs):** These are excellent for content-heavy, documentation-focused websites. They typically build fast-loading static HTML files.  
  * **Docusaurus:** Built with React, Docusaurus is specifically optimized for creating documentation websites.62 Its support for MDX (Markdown combined with React components) makes it a strong candidate if the goal is to embed interactive diagrams built with React Flow or custom D3.js visualizations wrapped as React components. It also offers features like versioning and internationalization (i18n) out-of-the-box.  
  * **Jekyll:** A Ruby-based SSG, known for its simplicity and strong integration with GitHub Pages.62 It's a good choice for blogs and straightforward project sites. Incorporating complex JavaScript interactivity might require more manual setup.  
  * **Hugo:** Written in Go, Hugo is renowned for its extremely fast build times and flexibility.62 It can handle content-heavy sites efficiently. While JavaScript can be included, seamless integration of complex interactive diagrams needs careful planning.  
  * **Eleventy (11ty):** A JavaScript-based SSG that is highly flexible and unopinionated, allowing developers to use various templating languages.62  
* **JavaScript UI Libraries/Frameworks:** These are more suited for websites requiring a high degree of interactivity or when building complex single-page applications (SPAs).  
  * **React (often with Next.js or Create React App):** React is a popular library for building user interfaces.65 Next.js is a comprehensive React framework that supports static site generation, server-side rendering (SSR), and API routes, making it excellent for performance and SEO.62 This is a natural choice if using React Flow for the diagram or if D3.js visualizations are built as React components.  
  * **Vue.js (often with Nuxt.js or Vite):** Vue is another widely adopted progressive JavaScript framework, known for its ease of integration.65 Nuxt.js is its counterpart to Next.js, offering similar capabilities for building modern web applications.  
  * **Angular:** A more opinionated and comprehensive framework, also component-based.65 It can integrate with D3.js for visualizations.40

The desire for an "aesthetic UI/UX" website, potentially featuring an interactive MCT diagram, suggests that frameworks with robust component models and strong JavaScript support—such as React, Vue, or Docusaurus (leveraging MDX for React components)—would be advantageous. Simpler SSGs might prove too restrictive for embedding advanced custom visualizations unless the diagram is presented merely as a static image. If interactivity is a primary goal for the diagram, Docusaurus or a full JavaScript framework like Next.js would offer a more streamlined development experience compared to trying to force complex JavaScript into a more basic SSG.

### **4.2. Structuring Website Content for Optimal Clarity and Impact**

A clear and logical website structure is essential for making the research accessible and understandable. Consider organizing content into sections such as:

* **Home/Overview:** Project title (e.g., "MedCode-Transformer: Methodology and Architecture"), a concise abstract summarizing the project's goals and significance.  
* **Methodology:** This section would be central.  
  * A high-level explanation of the problem domain (e.g., challenges in automated ICD coding, need for high-quality synthetic medical text).  
  * Introduction to the MedCode-Transformer (MCT) and its objectives.  
  * **Detailed Architecture:** This is where the visual diagram of the MCT model would be prominently featured, accompanied by explanatory text.  
  * Sub-sections detailing key aspects of the methodology, drawing from the thesis plan 1:  
    * Tokenization Strategy (Chapter 1\)  
    * Embedding Preparation (Chapter 2, including Factorized Embeddings and RoPE)  
    * MCT Encoder Architecture and Pre-training (Chapter 3, including GQA and Interleaved Local/Global Attention)  
    * MCT Decoder Architecture, Connection, and Pre-training (Chapter 5, including Masked Self-Attention with GQA and Cross-Attention)  
    * Other relevant methodology chapters (e.g., Comorbidity Group Identification if pertinent to the website's scope).  
* **Results/Experiments (Optional):** If preliminary results are available and appropriate to share, this section could highlight key findings or performance metrics.  
* **Interactive Demo (If an interactive diagram is developed):** A dedicated page or section allowing users to explore the interactive visualization.  
* **Publications/Code:** Links to the M.Tech thesis document (once available), any related publications, and the project's code repository (e.g., GitHub).  
* **About/Team:** Information about the researcher(s) involved.

Inspiration for structuring technical content can be drawn from AI research lab websites 66 and individual researcher project portfolios 71, adapting their presentation styles to the scope of an M.Tech project. The problem-research-solution flow often seen in UX case studies can also be a useful narrative structure.73

### **4.3. Embedding and Presenting the MCT Diagram**

The visual diagram is a cornerstone of the methodology presentation on the website.

* **Static Image (PNG/SVG):** The simplest method is to embed the diagram as a static image. SVG format is highly recommended over PNG for web use because it is vector-based, ensuring scalability and crispness at any resolution without loss of quality. Ensure the exported SVG is optimized.  
* **Interactive Embed:** If an interactive diagram is created using D3.js or React Flow, it will be embedded as a JavaScript component within the website.  
  * Carefully consider how interactions (e.g., hover effects for tooltips, click to expand/collapse sections, zoom and pan) genuinely enhance understanding versus merely adding complexity or distraction.  
  * The "Transformer Explainer" provides a strong example of how interactivity can be used for educational purposes.27  
  * Ensure the interactive visualization is responsive and functions well across different screen sizes and devices.  
  * Docusaurus's MDX support facilitates embedding React components 63, while frameworks like React or Vue natively handle their respective component systems.

### **4.4. UI/UX Best Practices for Academic/Technical Project Websites**

A positive user experience on the project website enhances the research's credibility and the audience's engagement.

* **Clarity and Readability:** Use clear, legible fonts with appropriate sizing for body text and headings. Ensure good color contrast between text and background. Utilize ample white space to prevent a cluttered appearance and improve focus.  
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Implement a simple, logical, and easy-to-find navigation menu. The overall page flow should be intuitive, allowing users to easily find the information they seek.10  
* **Responsive Design:** The website must adapt gracefully to various screen sizes, providing a good experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.  
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Strive to adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This includes providing alternative text for images (including the main diagram if static), ensuring keyboard navigability, and maintaining good color contrast.  
* **Professional Aesthetic:** Aim for a clean, modern, and professional design. Avoid overly flashy animations or design elements that could distract from the technical content.10 The visual style should align with the seriousness of academic research.  
* **Performance and Load Time:** Optimize all assets, especially images (including SVGs) and JavaScript bundles, to ensure the website loads quickly. Slow load times can deter visitors.

General UI/UX advice and examples can be found in various resources.10

## **5\. Integrated Workflow and Best Practices**

A systematic approach to creating both the diagram and the website will ensure efficiency and coherence.

### **5.1. A Step-by-Step Approach to Diagram and Website Creation**

A structured workflow is recommended:

1. **Finalize MCT Architectural Parameters:** Confirm all layer counts, dimensions, head counts, and other specifications from the thesis plan.1 Refer to Table 1\.  
2. **Sketch Diagram Layout:** Create low-fidelity sketches of the overall diagram layout and how individual components (encoder block, decoder block, attention mechanisms) will be represented.  
3. **Select Diagramming Tool(s):** Based on the desired output (static or interactive), aesthetic goals, and technical skillset, choose the appropriate diagramming tool or combination of tools. Refer to Table 2\.  
4. **Develop the Diagram:** Create the visual diagram, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and aesthetics. Iterate on the design.  
5. **Obtain Feedback on Diagram:** Share drafts of the diagram with peers, mentors, or even those less familiar with Transformers to test its clarity and identify areas for improvement.  
6. **Select Website Framework:** Choose a web development framework that aligns with the type of diagram (static vs. interactive) and the desired website features. Refer to Table 3\.  
7. **Structure Website Content:** Outline the website's information architecture and content for each section, ensuring a logical flow.  
8. **Develop the Website:** Build the website, integrating the finalized diagram prominently in the methodology section.  
9. **Test Thoroughly:** Test the website across different browsers, devices, and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and correct rendering. If interactive elements are included, test their functionality extensively.  
10. **Deploy:** Deploy the website to a suitable hosting platform.

### **5.2. Ensuring Visual Accuracy and Consistency with the Thesis Plan**

Accuracy is paramount in technical communication. The visual diagram and website content must meticulously align with the details presented in the M.TECH THESIS PLAN FINAL 28-05-2025.pdf 1 and its summarized architectural specifications.1

* All labels for layers, components, and parameters (e.g., dmodel​, nheadse​​, Ld​) in the diagram must exactly match the terminology and values used in the thesis document.  
* The depiction of data flow, connections between modules, and the internal workings of components like attention mechanisms must accurately reflect the model's described behavior.  
* Use consistent terminology across the diagram, website text, and the thesis itself to avoid confusion. Any discrepancies between the visual representations and the textual descriptions can undermine the credibility of the research.

### **5.3. Tips for Iterative Design and Feedback**

The creation of both the diagram and the website should be an iterative process.

* **Start with Low-Fidelity:** Begin with rough sketches for the diagram and wireframes for the website layout. This allows for quick exploration of ideas without investing significant time in polished visuals.  
* **Seek Feedback Early and Often:** Share early drafts with peers, mentors, and supervisors. Feedback on clarity, accuracy, and aesthetics is invaluable. Even non-experts can provide useful insights into whether the diagram is intuitively understandable.  
* **Iterate Based on Feedback:** Be prepared to revise and refine both the diagram and the website design based on the feedback received. Multiple iterations are common and lead to a more polished and effective final product.  
* **Version Control:** Use version control systems (like Git) for both diagramming code (if applicable) and website code to track changes and facilitate collaboration or rollback if needed.

## **Conclusions and Recommendations**

The creation of a high-quality visual diagram and an accompanying project website is a critical step in communicating the methodology of the MedCode-Transformer. The primary goal should be to produce a diagram that is not only technically accurate in representing all specified layers, dimensions, and components (such as factorized embeddings, RoPE, GQA, and interleaved local/global attention) but also aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand for a technical audience.

**For Diagram Creation:**

* **Prioritize Clarity and Accuracy:** The diagram must faithfully represent the MCT architecture as detailed in the thesis plan.1  
* **Static Diagram Recommendation:** For an M.Tech thesis, a high-quality static SVG diagram is likely the most pragmatic and effective solution.  
  * **Tools:** A combination of a GUI-based vector graphics editor like **Figma** or **Adobe Illustrator** for designing the overall aesthetic, custom shapes, and layout, complemented by a code-based approach like **PlotNeuralNet** (if proficient in LaTeX/TikZ) or custom **Python scripting (with libraries that can output SVG)** for generating repetitive elements like layer stacks with precise annotations, could yield excellent results. Alternatively, meticulously crafting the entire diagram in Figma or Illustrator is feasible if design skills are strong. **draw.io** is a good free alternative for a purely GUI-based approach.  
* **Interactive Diagram (Conditional):** If time and technical expertise permit, and if significant pedagogical value can be demonstrated, an interactive diagram using **React Flow** (if the website is React-based) or **D3.js** could be considered. However, the development effort is substantially higher.

**For Website Development:**

* **Framework Choice:**  
  * If a static diagram is chosen, **Docusaurus** offers an excellent balance of documentation features, ease of use (with MDX for content), and the ability to incorporate React components if some minor interactivity is desired later. It is well-suited for technical project websites.63  
  * If a highly interactive diagram (e.g., built with React Flow) is pursued, then a framework like **Next.js** (React) would be a more natural fit, providing full control over the React environment.  
* **Content Focus:** The website should clearly explain the MCT methodology, with the visual diagram as a central explanatory element. The structure should be logical and navigation intuitive.  
* **UI/UX:** Emphasize a clean, professional, and responsive design that prioritizes readability and accessibility.

**General Recommendations:**

1. **Start with Detailed Planning:** Thoroughly deconstruct the MCT architecture (Section 1\) and sketch out diagram ideas before committing to specific tools.  
2. **Iterate and Seek Feedback:** The design process for both the diagram and website should be iterative, incorporating feedback at multiple stages.  
3. **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure that all visual and textual information is consistent across the diagram, website, and the thesis document itself.  
4. **Balance Aesthetics with Technicality:** The "aesthetic UI/UX" requirement should enhance, not obscure, the technical information. The primary purpose is clear communication of a complex deep learning model.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the recommended tools and techniques, it is possible to create compelling visual and web-based presentations of the MedCode-Transformer methodology that effectively communicate its innovative aspects to the research community.
